# Compressors Predictive Maintenance

In this notebook, the predictive maintenance problem is applied to air compressors.

Intention of this notebook is to follow-up thesis accomplishment. Many items are still pending and a substantial improvement is expected by Februrary next year. I would appreciate any feedback given. 

The front-end hasnâ€™t yet been finalised and a MVP version is expected by presentation time.

P.S. Only the notebook has been uploaded. Google Colab has been used since intention was to apply deep learning. Once request for the colab file is granted, all the files are located in my Google Drive.
